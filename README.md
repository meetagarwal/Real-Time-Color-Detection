# Real-Time-Color-Detection

<br>
This Python script detects the color of an object in real-time using OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, identifies the color of the object at the center of the frame, and displays the color name on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

- ## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Hold an object in front of your webcam.

3. The color of the object will be displayed on the screen.

4. Press `q` to exit the program.

## Result

You can include a screenshot or example image here to demonstrate how the color detection works.
